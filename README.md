Note if you are going to play this game multiple times you need to refresh the page everytime the game ends.

Also note that if it is a drawn and you are waiting for an alert to let you know that the game ended, get a chair you will be waiting for a while.

Materials needed for the game: pen and paper so you can write down and keep track of who is winning, old is cool.
